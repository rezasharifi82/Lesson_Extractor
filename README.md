## Sorry??
In Iranian universities, there are some useless courses to which nobody pays attention. However, we are required to pass them during our bachelor's degree. Since these courses lack scientific requirements to be considered as university-level courses,everybody in this country trying to pass these course without any considerable amount of efforts to learning them deeply. On the other hand, we are not eligible to skip these courses. That's why everybody looking for the best presenter in the university.
## What's the problem?
In fact, there is a massive problem for students to find a suitable time alongside a good presenter. So, I've decided to develop this project to help my friends having a better experience of unit selection.    
## How does it work?!
At first, you should download the total table of the presented lesson from the university portal.Then, you should copy those html codes into .html file (e.g. dd.html) .    
In the end you should download the notebook while you've that kind of file hirearchy.

Now,try to run the notebook cell by cell.
at the end you are going to have this kind of dataframe:
